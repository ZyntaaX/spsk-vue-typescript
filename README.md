# Team website for Skillingaryds Pistolskytteklubb
## What is this?
This is the main repo for the website of Skillingaryds Pistolskytteklubb ([Current website](https://www.laget.se/SPSK)).

This repo is a mono repo consisting of both the frontend (client) and the backend (server).

__IN PROGRESS! This setup does not yet work!__
## Setup
### Project
1. Pull the repo and run the command ```yarn```.
2. Start the dev-server using ```yarn start```.

### Local PostgreSQL database
1. Download PostgreSQL from [here](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads).
    * When you get to the point where you can choose which items to install, uncheck PgAdmin and StackBuilder (if possible).
    * _Note: Remember the password and port number you choose when installing. This is needed later_
2. Download and install DBeaver from [here](https://dbeaver.io/download/).
    * When starting DBeaver, make a new connection to a PostgreSQL database with the port number and password you chose in the step above.
